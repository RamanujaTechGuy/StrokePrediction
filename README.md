# CLASSIFYING STROKE RISK WITH MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

## Introduction
Strokes are medical emergencies where blood flow to the brain is disrupted, potentially causing severe brain damage or death. Predicting stroke risk based on medical, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors can empower individuals and medical professionals to take preventive action. 

> **Did you know?**  
> Each year, over 795,000 people in the United States experience a stroke, with approximately 137,000 resulting in fatalities.

## Objective
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke, helping healthcare providers identify high-risk individuals and reduce the overall probability of stroke occurrences.

## How Machine Learning Can Help
With the vast amount of health data collected from devices like blood pressure monitors and medical imaging systems, machine learning models can uncover patterns and conditions leading to strokes. These insights could enable early intervention and better prevention strategies.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, correlations, and key risk factors in the data.
3. **Model Building**: Training various machine learning models to predict stroke risk.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective model.

## Impact
By using predictive analytics, this project contributes to:
- Helping individuals take proactive health measures.
- Supporting medical professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.
- Advancing research in healthcare analytics and machine learning.
